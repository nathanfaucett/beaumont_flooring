        "body0": "BoMont flooring is a family owned and operated floor covering installation and inspection organization headquartered in Dallas GA, and is the brainchild of myself (Tammy) and my husband Scott. I am a native GA girl, born and bred. Scott is Canadian through and through. Born in Nova Scotia, but spent the majority of his formative years in Prince George, British Columbia. He eventually made his way to GA by way of Puerto Rico in 2007 and the rest as you can say is history. We are a blended family and combined have four children; three boys and one girl. It is the children",
        "body1": "that inspired us to branch out on our own and to grow a business we can be proud of and hopefully one day pass on to them. A legacy if you will to leave behind. Scott has well over 20 years of floor covering experience; residential and commercial. I myself have a BBA in Business Management and have over 20 years of relevant experience, nine of which are in the floor covering industry.",
        "body2": "At BoMont flooring we believe that life is guided mainly by the relationships that we form with others. Be that a relationship between man and wife, parent and child, family, friend, coworker, customer etc. It is these relationships and bonds that we build with others that guide us,",
        "body3": "our personal life as much as the life of a business. We know that in order to be successful we have to invest in relationships with our customers, cultivate that relationship and stren-gthen the bond through, honesty, reliability and integrity."
